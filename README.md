## General Information

A Caesar cipher, or shift cipher, is a monoalphabetic cipher substitution cipher. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced in a toroidal manner by a letter N places down the used alphabet. Any rotation cipher: ROT5, ROT13, etc. is essentially a Caesar cipher. Caesar ciphers are nowadays mostly used in puzzles and provide virtually zero security.

Frequency analysis is the practice of counting letters in text. If you could collect all the books written in a certain language and map out the frequency of each letter in those books you could calculate the relative frequency of each letter in a given text of that language. This counting can be done by each letter (unigrams) but also by each 2 letters (bigrams) and even each n letters (n-grams). Because the Caesar cipher only shifts letters, and therefore n-grams, the frequencies of the n-grams is unchanged. This means you can analyse the given text on the frequency of n-grams and calculate which shift results in the closest representation of the relative frequencies.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

If you would like to add an language you're free to do so. Find a reputable source of unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies of your language and add a function similair as is done in [`language.v`](https://github.com/418Coffee/caesar-salad/blob/main/language.v).
